	<h4>Your First Game (Walkthrough)</h4>
	<p>
		The following walkthrough will create a simple game "table" with 3 channels (in-character, out-of-character, and game master), a game master, and 4 players and assumes a cateogry named <code>my-game</code> contains the channels <code>my-game-ic</code>, <code>my-game-ooc</code>, and <code>my-game-gm</code>.

		Sage does not (currently) change Discord permissions on channels to hide/show them for users (such as hiding a GM Only channel from players).
		The permissions set below simply tell Sage if it should respond to a Game Master or a Player in a given channel, and which types of commands it should respond to in those channels.
		You still (currently) need to change permissions on channels through Discord to ensure GMs and players see the channels they are meant to be seeing.
