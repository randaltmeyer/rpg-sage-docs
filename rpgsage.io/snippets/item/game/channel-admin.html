	<h5>Channel Admin</h5>
	<p>
		<code>sage! help admin channel</code>
		<br/>
		<br/>These commands are for managing what features are available on each channel.
		<br/><code>sage!! channel add #ChannelReference {optionKey}="optionValue"</code>
		<br/><code>sage!! channel details</code>
		<br/><code>sage!! channel list {game|server}</code>
		<br/><code>sage!! channel remove #ChannelReference</code>
		<br/><code>sage!! channel set {optionKey}="optionValue"</code>
		<br/>Channel Options <em>(can set multiple options at the same time)</em>:
		<br/>
		<br/>- admin="true|false"
		<br/>- commands="true|false" <em>(also known as non-admin commands)</em>
		<br/>- dialog="true|false"
		<br/>- dice="true|false"
		<br/>- search="true|false"
		<br/>- - This determines which types of commands (admin, non-admin, dialog, dice, search) are allowed.
		<br/>
		<br/>- crit="timestwo|rolltwice|addmax|unset"
		<br/>- - TIMESTWO rolls the dice and multiplies the results x2. <em>(default)</em>
		<br/>- - ROLLTWICE rolls the damage twice and adds the results together.
		<br/>- - ADDMAX rolls the dice once and then adds max damage to the result. <em>(house rule)</em>
		<br/>- - UNSET uses the crit method inherited from either the game or the server.
		<br/>
		<br/>- diceoutput="xxs|xs|s|m|l|xl|xxl|rollem|unset"
		<br/>- - This determines how compact or expanded the dice results are displayed.
		<br/>- - ROLLEM uses the diceoutput method that most closely emulates what Rollem uses.
		<br/>- - UNSET uses the diceoutput method inherited from either the game or the server.
		<br/>
		<br/>- dicepost="post|embed|unset"
		<br/>- - POST will output dice results in a simple post.
		<br/>- - EMBED will output dice results in an embed in a post.
		<br/>- - ~~REPLY will output dice results in a reply to the input.~~ <em>(future feature)</em>
		<br/>- - UNSET uses the dicepost method inherited from either the game or the server.
		<br/>
		<br/>- game="pf2e|none"
		<br/>- - This determines which game is being played.
		<br/>- - PF2E Currently Pathfinder Second Edition is the only game that Sage recognizes.
		<br/>- - The primary place this is noticable is the dice engine: PF2E dice know about ACs, DCs, and how to calculate Critical Success and Failure.
		<br/>
		<br/>- gamemaster="none|write"
		<br/>- player="none|write"
		<br/>- - NONE The user (gamemaster, player) should not have access to this channel.
		<br/>- - WRITE The user (gamemaster, player) should have full access to this channel.
		<br/>- - Note: A channel that is gamemaster=write and player=none is considered a GM only channel and is where secret dice rolls are sent!
