<br/>&bull; IC denotes an In Character channel, thus only Dialog and Dice are allowed for GMs and Players.
<br/>&bull; OOC denotes an Out of Character channel, thus all Sage commands are allowed for GMs and Players.
<br/>&bull; MISC denotes an Miscellaneous channel, thus all Sage commands are allowed for GMs and Players.
