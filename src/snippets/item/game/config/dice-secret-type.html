<br/>This determines how Sage reacts to dice with the word "secret" in them.
<br/>&bull; DM tells Sage to find the first available GM and send the dice results to them as a DM.
<br/>&bull; GM tells Sage to find a GM channel and send the dice results there. If no GM channel exists, this is treated as DM.
<br/>&bull; HIDE tells Sage to hide/redact the results using spoiler tags.
<br/>&bull; IGNORE <small>default</small> simply ignores them.
<br/>&bull; UNSET uses the dicesecret method inherited from either the game or server.
