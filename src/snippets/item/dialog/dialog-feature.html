				Once configured, RPG Sage's dialog feature allows players and game masters to post as their characters with little more than starting their post with <code>pc::</code> or <code>gm::</code>, and sometimes even less!
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>PC Dialog for Players</strong>
				<br/>
				Players will generally post their dialog by using the <code>pc::</code> command; posting as their Player Character for the current game.
				PCs can also have alts, companions, familiars, hirelings, and more!
				Once added to a PC, you would post as those other characters using their various dialog commands, such as <code>alt::</code> or <code>familiar::Fluffy Kitty::</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>NPC Dialog for Game Masters</strong>
				<br/>
				Game masters will generally post their dialog by using the <code>npc::</code> command.
				Because there are generally many NPCs to a Game Master (as opposed to one PC per Player) you must include the name of the NPC you are posting as, such as <code>npc::Mayor Cogsgrove::</code>.
				For convenience, there is a built in NPC called "Game Master" that GMs can post as by simply using the <code>gm::</code> dialog command.
