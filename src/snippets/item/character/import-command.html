		<code>/sage import</code>
		<br/>
		<br/>This slash command is used to import characters so that you can view their stats and quickly roll dice/macros.
		<br/>
		<br/>The two main options (<code>pathbuilder2e-id</code> and <code>e20-pdf</code>) are for your character source and you can only use one of them at a time.
		The other two options (<code>attach</code> and <code>pin</code>) change how Sage posts your imported character and you can use either, both, or neither of them.
		<br/>
		<br/><code>/sage import pathbuilder2e-id:12345</code>
		<br/>This requires the export "Pathbuilder 2e JSON ID" that you get from Pathbuilder 2e via the "Export JSON" command.
		<br/>
		<br/><code>/sage import e20-pdf:joe-cool.pdf</code>
		<br/>This requires either the url to a PDF or the url to a Discord message that has a PDF file as an attachment.
		The PDF must be one official PDFs downloaded from Renegade Games Studios.
		<br/>
		<br/><code>attach="true"</code>
		<br/>When set to true, this tells Sage to post the character as a .txt file attachment instead of creating an interactive character sheet.
		<br/>
		<br/><code>pin="true"</code>
		<br/>When set to true, this tells Sage to pin the post that it creates for the character.
