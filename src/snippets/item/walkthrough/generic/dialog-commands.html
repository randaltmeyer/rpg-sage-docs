		At this point, you have an NPC and some PCs, possibly some companions.
		<br/>Run these commands in the <code>#my-game-ic</code> channel.
		<br/>
		<br/>To test the GM's basic narration, the GM can use the following commands:
		<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>gm::This is a basic narrative dialog</code>
		<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>gm::(Fun Title)::This is a narrative dialog with a special title!</code>
		<br/>
		<br/>To test the NPC's dialog, the GM can use the following commands:
		<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>npc::Cool NPC Name::This is a simple NPC dialog</code>
		<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>npc::Cool NPC Name(Alernate Title)::This changes the NPC's dialog to hide the name of unknown NPCs!</code>
		<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>ally::Cool NPC Name::This changes the NPC's dialog color to the ally color (green by default)</code>
		<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>enemy::Cool NPC Name::This changes the NPC's dialog color to the enemy color (red by default)</code>
		<br/>
		<br/>To test the PC's dialog, a Player can use the following command:
		<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>pc::This is a simple PC dialog</code>
		<br/>
		<br/>If they have a companion, a Player can use the following commands:
		<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>companion::This posts as a PC's Companion</code>
		<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>companion::2::This posts as a PC's 2nd Companion!</code>
		<br/>
		<br/>NOTE! All alts, companions, and hirelings are created using the <code>companion</code> command, and thus there is only one list.
		When you have more than one, if you don't provide their number in the list, the command will always use the first one, regardless of which command you used to post (<code>alt::</code>, <code>companion::</code>, <code>hireling::</code>).
