		Message Commands are commands given to Sage by posting a message into chat, either a channel where Sage has access or via a direct message to Sage.

			To further understand a Message Command, think of them as having the following components: Prefix, Action, Command, SubCommands, and Arguments.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Prefix</strong> is there so that you can have multiple bots that know to ignore commands intended for other bots.</li>
			<li><strong>Action</strong> distinguishes between telling Sage to do something and asking Sage to find something.</li>
			<li><strong>Command</strong> is specifically what task you want Sage to do.</li>
			<li><strong>SubCommand</strong> break down commands further <small>such as add/remove</small>.</li>
			<li><strong>Arguments</strong><sup>1,2</sup> are any details you need to give Sage so that it can do the task for you.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<sup>1</sup>Arguments are sometimes given as one word (<code>name</code>), multiple words with quotes around them (<code>"Vash the Stampede"</code>), and other times key/value pairs (<code>name="Vash the Stampede"</code>).
			<br/><sup>2</sup>If you see in these guides (or in the help) <code>@UserMention</code>, you need to ensure that Discord created a proper User Mention for Sage to be able to properly find the user. <small>A "Proper User Mention" means that Discord recognized the user you were trying to mention and replaced your entered text with a link to the user. See image below.</small>
