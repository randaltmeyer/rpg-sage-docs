		<strong>Advantage / Disadvantage (+/-)</strong>
		<br/>If your roll has Advantage, you may roll <code>[+2d20]</code> to tell RPG Sage to roll twice and take the higher of the two dice.
		Likewise, if you have Disadvantage, you may use <code>[-2d20]</code> to roll twice and take the lower of the two dice.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Graded Success / Failure</strong>
		<br/>When playing DnD 5e, a Natural 20 is a Critical Success and Natural 1 is a Critical Failure.
		RPG Sage takes this into account when you roll using AC, DC, or VS and changes the emoji used accordingly.
		Additionally, when you roll an attack/damage combo <code>[1d20 ac 10; 1d6 damage]</code> RPG Sage will know to double the damage if your success was critical.
