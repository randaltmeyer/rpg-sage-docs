		<strong>Fortune / Misfortune (+/-)</strong>
		<br/>If your roll has Fortune, you may roll <code>[+2d20]</code> to tell RPG Sage to roll twice and take the higher of the two dice.
		Likewise, if you have Misfortune, you may use <code>[-2d20]</code> to roll twice and take the lower of the two dice.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Multi Attack Penalty (MAP)</strong>
		<br/>If you are rolling the same attack multiple times, you can simplify your roll by combining the multiple roll modifier <code>2#</code> with <code>MAP-5</code>.
		You can, of course, roll more than twice and change the MAP to another value (most likely 4).
		<br/><code>[2MAP-5#1d20 ac 10; 1d6 damage]</code>
		<br/><code>[3MAP-4#1d20 ac 10; 1d6 damage]</code>
	</p>

		<strong>Graded Success / Failure</strong>
		<br/>When playing Pathfinder 2e, a Success of 10 or more is a Critical Success, while a Failure of 10 or more is a Critical Failure.
		Additionally, a natural 1 lowers your success grade by 1 while a natural 20 increases your success grade by 1.
		RPG Sage takes this into account when you roll using AC, DC, or VS and changes the emoji used accordingly.
		Additionally, when you roll an attack/damage combo <code>[1d20 ac 10; 1d6 damage]</code> RPG Sage will know to double the damage if your success was critical.
	</p>

		<strong>Striking, Greater Striking, Deadly, and Fatal</strong>
		<br/>When playing Pathfinder 2e, there is some extra math involved in critical hits when you have striking, deadly, and fatal weapons.
		RPG Sage looks at the input of your dice to see if it can find any of these when calculating your critical damage.
		<br/><code>[1d20 + 10 ac 10 pick (fatal d10); 1d6 piercing]</code>
		<br/><code>[1d20 + 10 ac 10 longbow (deadly d10); 1d8 piercing]</code>
		<br/><code>[1d20 + 10 ac 10 striking longsword; 1d8 slashing]</code>
		<br/><code>[1d20 + 10 ac 10 greater striking longsword; 1d8 slashing]</code>
		<br/><code>[1d20 + 10 ac 10 major striking longsword; 1d8 slashing]</code>
