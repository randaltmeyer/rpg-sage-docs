	<p>
		While you can use the basic dice engine for any system (all you need is to roll and maybe test results), you are likely used to seeing certain syntax in your rolls.
		Additionally, there are a number of tests and other bits of math that are performed with almost every roll of many games.
		With RPG Sage, when you set your Channel, Game, or Server to a specific Game (such as Pathfinder 2e), the Dice engine will know to perform many of these actions for you.
		<small>We plan to continue adding more games as well as expanding the things we can do within each game.</small>

		<strong>Success / Failure</strong> <small>core dice engine</small>
		<br/>When rolling a test, the output will include an emoji to indicate success or failure. By default, these are :thumbs_up: and :thumbs_down:.
