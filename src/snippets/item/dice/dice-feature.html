				RPG Sage's Dice Feature, at its most basic, it enables you to roll dice and post the results.
			</p>
			<p>
				The simplest form of this is the humble <code>[1d20]</code> roll.
			</p>
			<p>
				As you get more comfortable using it, you will find that you can enter multiple rolls (each with their own description) into a single dice command so that RPG Sage can group the results together to make it easier for your group to find and read dice rolls that belong together.
				The most common form of this is the attack and damage roll combo of d20 games: <code>[1d20 attack; 1d8 damage]</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can, of course, include modifiers to die rolls (even more dice types) and even give each modifier a description should you choose to.
				For example, a common d20 rogue might roll <code>[1d20 + 8 dagger attack; 1d4 piercing + 2 strength + 1d6 sneak]</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Additionally, we have customized dice for multiple games that automate things like Pathfinder 2e MAP <small>Multi Attack Penalty</small>, critical success, and even deadly or fatal weapon damage!
