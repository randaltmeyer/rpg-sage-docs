				Once you really start using dice rolls in RPG Sage, you will find that you wind up doing a <em>lot</em> of copy/paste actions.
				To alleviate this, we have implemented a fairly robust Macro Feature.
				At the basic level, dice macros allow you to avoid copying and pasting long dice commands by creating a short cut (called "macro").

				Using our example above of a sneak attack, we can see that it would get annoying constantly typing (or even copy/pasting) <code>[1d20 + 8 dagger attack; 1d4 piercing + 2 strength + 1d6 sneak]</code> over and over.
				By creating a macro named (conveniently and descriptively) "sneak dagger", we find it much more wieldy to use that attack roll on a regular basis by simply using <code>[sneak dagger]</code>.
