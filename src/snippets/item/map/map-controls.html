	<p>
		<strong>Movement Arrows</strong> <small>left side</small>
		<br/>
		Move your active token (or terrain if GM) one square in the direction indicated.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Gear</strong>
		<br/>
		Disabled; saved for future use.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Mountain</strong>
		<br/>
		GM uses this button to cycle through the terrain images to select the active terrain.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Yellow Circle</strong>
		<br/>
		Cycle through aura images (for the active token) to select the active aura.
		A token can have any number of auras configured, but only one can be active at a time.
		(This also applies to terrain for GMs.)
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Person</strong>
		<br/>
		Cycle through token images to select the active token.
		Players can only cycle through tokens assigned to them.
		GMs cycle through all tokens.
		If you are using RPG Sage's Game feature, a PC's token (along with familiars/companions) should be added automatically to the map when trying to select their token.
		<small>There is a known bug in the current code that will likely spawn a PC's token even if you already assigned them a token when making the map.</small>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Up / Down Arrows</strong> <small>right side</small>
		<br/>
		GMs can use this to reorder (alter the z-index) of the terrain and tokens.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Red X</strong>
		<br/>
		GM uses this button to delete terrain / tokens.
		<small>The thought was you import a map for an encounter with all baddies and delete them as they are removed from play.</small>
