				Yes, you heard that right, we can do maps!
				And all you have to do is create a metadata text file that has a name ending in <code>.map.txt</code> and then drop the file in the channel you want your map.
				Sage will take it from there!

				<strong>Note about prototype.</strong>
				<br/>
				This feature is still a prototype, perhaps consider it an alpha release.
				The interface and feedback aren't as clean as we want and the execution of features is a tad clumsy.
				But, we assure you that we already have planned improvements that will make it much better!
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Note about image storage.</strong>
				<br/>
				RPG Sage doesn't store any images used in the creation of maps.
				Therefore, you will need to make sure that they are all public urls that will be available until you are no longer using the map.
				The simplest way to do this is to post the image(s) into a discord channel and then grab the url from the uploaded image(s).
