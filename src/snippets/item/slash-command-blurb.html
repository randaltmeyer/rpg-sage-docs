		Slash commands are <strong>NOT</strong> posted to chat for RPG Sage to respond to, they are activated by typing a <code>/</code> (slash) and then selecting from the options provided by Discord.
		Typing <code>/sage</code> before selecting the command will help remove slash commands on the server that are not related to RPG Sage.
